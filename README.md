# Simple Mock for C language

## goal
- mocking API(s) only w/ including **one** header file.
- **easy to use** is more important than *many features*

## install
- copy the [scmock.h](https://github.com/datsuns/scmock/blob/master/scmock.h) into your test directory
- add include ``` #include <scmock.h>```
- Thats's all !!

## APIs
- TBD.
